The [Zoho Books](https://mage2.pro/t/4133) and [Zoho Inventory](https://mage2.pro/t/4134) APIs are much closer to each other than to the [Zoho CRM](https://mage2.pro/t/4132) one, so I decided to place the functionality, which is common to the Zoho Books and Zoho Inventory APIs and is different from Zoho CRM API, to this Composer package.  
You should not install this package directly: it is installed automatically by [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) with my «[**Zoho Books**](https://mage2.pro/c/extensions/zoho-books)» and «[**Zoho Inventory**](https://mage2.pro/c/extensions/zoho-inventory»)» Magento 2 extensions.  
This package depends on the [`mage2pro/zoho`](https://github.com/mage2pro/zoho) package, which contains the common funtionality for all the «Zoho Books», «[Zoho CRM](https://mage2.pro/c/extensions/zoho-crm)», and «Zoho Inventory» Magento 2 extensions.
